### Added
- This work, "AssetManager" by Neuru5278, is forked from ["AssetOrganizer" by Dreadrith](https://github.com/Dreadrith/AssetOrganizer) and [アセットを依存関係を保ったまま一括コピーするやつ.cs by k7a](https://gist.github.com/k7a/de776fb84ee060385a78505e1c43ed94).
- Copy action besides Move. Which takes care of replacing the GUID for the affected assets so that they're isolated.
- For folders, added the feature to work without organization.
